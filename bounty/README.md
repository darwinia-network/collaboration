# Bounty Program

We will rate the issues in Darwinia and invite community developers to help with the fix. Community developers can get rewards after fixing the issue and being reviewed. The rewards for fixing different levels of issue will be different.

## Bug Submission

Submit your findings and suggestions:

## Issue rating and fix review

The Issue rating and fix review will be officially completed by Darwinia and will be followed by the Github repository admin.

We only reward developers who submitted bugs or PR which fix issues and finally get merged.

## Reward

We will tag different issues with different rewards. Most of the issue rewards range from 10, 000 RING to 100, 000 RING.

Here is the approximate standard:

  low: 100, 000 RING,
  medium: 300,000 RING,
  high: >= 1000, 000 RING
